This application attempts to show the code necessary to perform the same task
in both ember.js and angular.js

The ember and angular apps are namespaced to /ember and /angular, respectively.

Ember is added in via the ember-rails gem.
Angular is added manually into the vendor directory as I didn't find the
angular-rails gem to be sufficient.
